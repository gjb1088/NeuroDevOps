# NeuroDevOps

**NeuroDevOps** is an experimental, self-improving infrastructure automation system. Built on a foundation of Ansible, Docker, and AI, it aims to proactively optimize and maintain complex environments by analyzing system reports, detecting inefficiencies, and proposing or applying improvements autonomously.

---

## 🔭 Project Vision

Imagine a DevOps pipeline that doesn't just automate — it *thinks*. NeuroDevOps is a containerized AI-driven platform designed to:
- Continuously scan, report, and analyze your infrastructure.
- Suggest optimizations or fixes in real time.
- Learn from human-approved feedback and improve future recommendations.

Inspired by cyberpunk ethos and powered by open-source tooling, NeuroDevOps blends automation with intelligence.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🧠 **AI Feedback Loop**: Uses LLMs (e.g. Mistral) with RAG to provide insightful suggestions on system and network data.
- 📦 **Containerized Architecture**: Each component runs in a Docker container for modularity and portability.
- 🔧 **Ansible Automation**: Plays, facts, and system diagnostics handled via Ansible.
- 📊 **Report Generation**: Custom PDF/HTML reports generated from live data.
- 🌐 **Dashboard** (planned): Web interface for reviewing AI suggestions, logs, and system state.
