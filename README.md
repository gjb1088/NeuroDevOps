# ⚡ NeuroDevOps

**NeuroDevOps** is an experimental, self-improving infrastructure automation system. Built on a foundation of Ansible, Docker, and AI, it aims to proactively optimize and maintain complex environments by analyzing system reports, detecting inefficiencies, and proposing or applying improvements autonomously.

---

## 🔭 Vision

Imagine a DevOps pipeline that doesn't just automate — it *thinks*. NeuroDevOps is a containerized AI-driven platform designed to:
- Continuously scan, report, and analyze your infrastructure.
- Suggest optimizations or fixes in real time.
- Learn from human-approved feedback and improve future recommendations.

---

## 🧰 Features

- 🧠 **AI Feedback Loop** — Uses LLMs (e.g. Mistral) with RAG for smart infrastructure suggestions.
- 🐳 **Containerized Architecture** — Modular containers for each core service.
- 📡 **Ansible Automation** — Declarative automation of diagnostics and data collection.
- 📊 **Dynamic Report Generation** — PDF/HTML reports built from real-time data.
- 🌐 **Dashboard UI (planned)** — Review AI suggestions, logs, and changes in one place.
